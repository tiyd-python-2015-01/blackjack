Playing blackjack:  (not sure how bets work yet so I still need to include it later when I find out how that works.)

The Dealer starts the game:
  - Shuffles Cards
  - Deals 2 cards to Player
              Deck is updated
    Hand is updated for Player
  - Deals 2 cards to Dealer
              Deck is updated
    Hand is updated for Dealer

if Player.Hand.Value() == Dealer.Hand.Value() == 21:  Blackjack Push. Game Ends. Update Game.Winner to Push
else
     if Player.Hand.Value() == 21 Game Ends. Update Game.Winner to Player
     if Dealer.Hand.Value() == 21 Game Ends. Update Game.Winner to Dealer
else   # no one got blackjack

While Player wants a hit:   (determine decision point to choose hit or stand)
    Dealer deals one Card.
    Hand for Player is updated
    if Player.Hand.Value()  > 21:  Player.status = bust.  Game ends. Dealer wins
    else: Hit or Stand? make decision

If Player.status == stand:
    while Dealer.Hand.value() < 17
         Dealer deals one Card (updates deck, updates hand)
         if value > 21  dealer.status = bust. Game ends. Player wins
    if dealer.status !- bust
           if Player.Hand.Value()  == Dealer.Hand.Value() Game ends. Winner = push
           else
              if Player.Hand.Value()  > Dealer.Hand.Value() game ends. player wins
               else   game ends. dealer wins.
